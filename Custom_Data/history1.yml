Attempting to revert to labor-services in place of money-contracts led to conflicts with peasants. Additionally, the Black Death further reduced the available workforce and wealth. Overall, these challenges disrupted the traditional feudal system and affected the economic well-being of lords.

- - How did the spread of the Black Death impact the religious, cultural, and demographic aspects of medieval European society?
  - The spread of the Black Death had a profound impact on medieval European society. It led to a significant loss of life, with an estimated 20% of the population perishing. This resulted in demographic shifts and depopulation. The cultural and religious aspects of society were also affected, as the trauma of the pandemic influenced art, literature, and religious practices.
